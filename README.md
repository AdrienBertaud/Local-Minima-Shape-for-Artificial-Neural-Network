## Local Minima Shape for Artificial Neural Network
by drien Bertaud, Yanis Bendali and Danya Li


### Training and evaluating sharpness and non-uniformity, results are stored in resutls.csv.
```
python train_and_eval.py
```

### Plot results from data stored in results.csv.
```
python plot_results.py
```

### Run toy examples to illustrate the influence of learning rate on the shape of minima found.
```
python toy_examples.py
```
